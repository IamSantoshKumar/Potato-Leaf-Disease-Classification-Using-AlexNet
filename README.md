Potato is one of the most used crops in the world and 2 nd most important crop in Bangladesh. Our economy is largely affected by the production of potato. But its production is hampered due to different diseases of potato leaves. These diseases decrease production and increase the price of potatoes. Our objective is to develop an automated system which will predict the potato disease and helps farmers to take necessary steps. In this work, we implemented a model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) & AlexNet(scratch) which provides 96 & 98.33% accurate result in predicting different diseases of potatoes.
